# my-dummy-project
A dummy project to practice and demonstrate my React skills. I made this project through the udemy course 'React - The Complete Guide' by Academind (Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller)

The app lets you write, fetch and checkout posts. The app includes a backend where the posts are stored locally in a JSON file. 
The react project is made with vite. 

# set up 
1) make sure you have node.js installed.
2) for backend: navigate in your terminal to the corrent folder
2.1) install the dependencies by entering ````npm install``
2.2) run ````npm start``
3) for frontend: navigate to correct folder
3.1) run ```npm install```
3.2) run ```npm run dev```
